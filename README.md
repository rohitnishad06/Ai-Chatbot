# AI-Based Chatbot

This project is an AI-powered chatbot that uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** to understand user queries and respond appropriately in real-time. It is built with a **React.js frontend**, **FastAPI backend**, and trained using Python-based ML models.

---

## Problem Statement

In the digital age, users expect instant and intelligent responses from systems. Manual support is often slow, inconsistent, and resource-intensive. An AI-based chatbot provides a scalable solution by offering 24/7 conversational support using machine learning and NLP.

---

## Features

- Intent recognition using ML classifier (Naive Bayes / Logistic Regression)
- Predefined responses for common queries
- Seamless frontend-backend integration
- Real-time chat interface using React
- Fast and lightweight backend using FastAPI
